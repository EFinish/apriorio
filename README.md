# apriorio
This is an application for creating statements and organizing them into a logical system. This could be useful for those who want to practice some ideas of logic in a playground setting.
## Conceptions
There are 6 main logical elements
1. subject - the noun of a logical statement
2. predicate - the verb, passive action, or active action of a subject
3. premises - a subject and a predicate together, also includes a subject quantifier (AKA how much of a subject are we talking about in the premise) and a predicate qualifier (AKA whether the predicate is true or not within the scope of the statement)
4. propositions - a system for conjunctions and other logical operations/connectors of premises and/or other propositions
    - for more info, [see this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective)
5. conditional statements - if-then statements, if X then Y (AKA X implies that Y)
6. arguments - a system for organizing sets of premises, propositions, and/or conditional statements into a list alongside a conclusive premise, proposition, or conditional statement for the set of logical statements
Example
1. subject - the ball
2. predicate - red (AKA is red)
3. premise - All of the ball is red
    - all of = subject quantifier
    - the ball = subject
    - is = predicate qualifier
    - red = predicate
4. proposition - All of the ball is red OR All of the ball is blue OR All of the ball is green
    - All of the ball is red = first premise in proposition
    - All of the ball is blue = second premise in proposition
    - All of the ball is green = third premise in proposition
    - OR = the propositional connector, in this case a disjunction
5. conditional statement - If all of the ball is red, Then All of time to play is now
    - If all of the ball is red = the 'causation' part of the conditional statement
    - Then it is time to play = the statement that becomes true if the causation statement is true
6. argument 
    1. If All of the ball is red, Then All of the time to play is now
    2. If All of the ball is blue, Then All of the time to play is NOT now
    3. All of the ball is red
    4. Conclusion: All of the time to play is now
    - statements 1-3 make up the logical universe of the argument
    - statement 4 is the conclusion of the argument when all of the statements in the logical universe of the argument are weighed against eachother
